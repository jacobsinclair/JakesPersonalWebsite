<h3>About Me</h3>

  <p>Hi, I'm Jacob Sinclair. I'm a second-year Computing & Information Studies student at Washington & Jefferson College. At W&J I am also a runner on the Cross Country & Track teams, a member of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity and a member of the Outdoors Club. </p>



<h4>W&J Cross Country / Track & Field</h4>

  <img class ="aboutme" src= "imgs/wjtrackteam.jpg" style="width: 30%; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" alt= "wjtfteam"/>

  <p>Being apart of the <a class="redtextlinks" href="https://gopresidents.com/sports/cross-country">cross country</a> and <a class="redtextlinks" href="https://gopresidents.com/sports/track-and-field">track & field</a> teams here at W&J has been a great experience for me so far. Through my time on the team I have been able to participate in the sport that I am passionate about while competing with great teammates, who share a high level of competiveness. These teams have given me some of my best friends, while helping me improve greatly as a runner in the short time of one year that I've been a part of it. If you wish to read more about my running career and experience you can access it on the <a class="bluetextlinks" href="running.html">"Running"</a> page of this site.</p>


<h4>Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity</h4>

<img class ="aboutme" src= "imgs/ato.jpg" style="width: 30%; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" alt= "ato"/>

  <p>As a member of <a class="bluetextlinks" href="https://ato.org/">Alpha Tau Omega</a> and executive board chair (Health & Safety), I am surronded by other members who share the same values as I do, and who are looking to serve their community through philantrophy events, and fundraising. Just recently, we held a fundraiser through the help of Chick-Fil-A in Washington, to help raise money for a childrens' Summer YMCA Camp, Camp Kon-O-Kwee. Another part of being a part of ATO, is having other people around you striving to do their best as students and as athletes (for those who are in athletics), which in turn makes you want to do the same. I have enjoyed my time as an ATO thus far, and hope to help others experience the same in the future.</p>

<h4>Outdoors Club</h4>

<img class ="aboutme" src= "imgs/outdoorsclub.png" style="width: 30%; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" alt= "outdoorsclub"/>

  <p>The outdoors have always been appealing to me, and most of my favorite activites to do are ones that take place outside, which is why I decided to join the <a class="bluetextlinks" href="https://www.instagram.com/wjoutdoorsclub/?hl=en">Outdoors Club</a> at W&J. These activites include running, snowboarding, playing soccer, skateboarding, and cooking out. The  Outdoors Club at W&J, offers a place for others who also are drawn to the outdoors to participate in various outdoor activites together, such as visiting local parks, hiking, rock climbing and more. Our signature event this year as a club was "Rocktober," a fall concert in which musicians from W&J and a local Pittsburgh Band performed for the student body.</p>

  <p>I plan to run for an Executive position in the club in the coming school year (2022-2023), in hopes to gain more funding for the club so that we can do more activities and create more opportunities for W&J students to be involved in the outdoors of the Washington community and the southwestern PA area.</p>
