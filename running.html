<h3>Running</h3>

  <p>Currently, I am a collegiate <a class="bluetextlinks" href="https://gopresidents.com/sports/mens-cross-country/roster/jake-sinclair/5158">runner</a> 
    for the <a class="redtextlinks" href="https://gopresidents.com/sports/cross-country">W&J Cross Country</a> and 
    <a class="redtextlinks" href="https://gopresidents.com/sports/track-and-field"> Track & Field</a> teams, competing in <a class="bluetextlinks" href="https://www.ncaa.org/sports/division-iii">NCAA Division 3</a>. 
    This year, 2023, is my 6th year of running. After being a former hater of running, I started running in my freshman year of high school, 
    through some convinving of a teammate of mine on the soccer team, of who I accredit a lot of my success in the sport to. 
    Originally the sport I loved the most was soccer, but throughout the years I've grown more and more passionate about running. 
    Since I started tracking the total mileage I've run in May of 2021, I've logged over 4000 miles, with the use of 
    my <a id="strava" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/84794091">Strava</a> account. </p>

  <p>Running is something in my life that keeps me humble. 
    It's a sport that shows that things don't always go your way, and often you have to struggle 
    through the losses to see improvement. It has also shown me that progress is almost never linear, there are ups and downs, 
    and you can't get too high on the highs or too low on the lows, sometimes you just have to trust the process.
    My main goal in running is for our Cross Country team to make NCAA D3 nationals, which is a tall task as a small team from a small school, 
    but when times get tough, I remind my teammates and myself, of these facts of the sport, 
    and that we just have to put our heads down and keep working for the betterment of one another.</p>
